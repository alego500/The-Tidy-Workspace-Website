        <h2>F.A.Q</h2>
         <h5>What is the Tidy Workspace Template?</h5>
        <p>It’s a workspace template for QLab 4. It contains settings and a collection of the scripts we’ve made or come across to improve QLab programming.
        It contains what we consider to be the most beneficial scripts to quickly program neat shows. Everyone is different, but we’ve tried to make a versatile kit that can be useful in many situations.</p>




        <h5>Do I have to know a lot about scripts to use the Tidy Workspace Template?</h5>
        <p>No, definitely not! That is why we have collected, curated and modified the scripts, to make them as easy to use as possible.</p>

        <h5>How do I setup the template on my computer?</h5>


        <p>It’s very simple. Once you have the most recent version of QLab installed, simply download our template and click it. We recommend setting the template as default, so you always get the features when you create a new workspace. If you want to use the scripts for an already started project, you can simply drag and drop the scripts cue list into your workspace. However, be aware that some of the scripts might not work as intended, since QLab’s settings are saved on a workspace basis. Using scripts requires a license, but you can try them out in QLab’s Demo Mode.</p>

        <h5>How do I use the Tidy Workspace Template scripts in my workspace?</h5>
        <p>Once you’ve set up the template and made a new workspace with it, simply press the associated hotkey trigger and let the script do its work. You can view the full list of scripts and get a description of each one in the ‘Scripts’ cue list, and get an overview on the Tidy Workspace Shortcut Mapper.</p>

        <h5>Which one of the scripts is your favorite?</h5>

      <p>The ‘Batch adjust’ is for sure one of the most versatile scripts we’ve come across. We call it “The swiss army knife for QLab programming”. While it might seem a little overwhelming at first, features like “Make series” and “Search & replace” quickly become indispensable.
        However some of the simple ones that are used frequently, end up saving a lot of time. “Group selected cues”, “Set cue color” and “Create fade in/out” are probably the ones we use the most. Once you start using them, you don’t want to go back.</p>

        <h5>Can I use my own scripts along the Tidy Workspace Template?</h5>

        <p>For sure you can! Feel free to delete, add or edit scripts as much as you want. If you feel like your changes could benefit others, don’t hesitate to reach out to Baldrian, with an email describing your suggestion at <a href="mailto:baldriansector@gmail.com">baldriansector@gmail.com</a>.
           Please include “Tidy Workspace Template” in the subject line.</p>

        <h5>Who made Tidy Workspace?</h5>
        <p>The two danish QLab aficionados Baldrian Sector and Alexander Hjalmarsson.</p>


        <h5>Who made the scripts?</h5>

        <p>A lot of the scripts originated from Rich Walsh’s template from 2019, Mic Pool’s QLab Cookbook and Sam’s Toolbox. They deserve all the credit we can give them! Some of the scripts we made or modified ourselves. It's also very important for us to mention the QLab Users and Programmers Facebook group and the QLab Google forum, which have been huge resources for us.</p>

        <h5>Is the template and shortcut mapper completely free to use?</h5>

        <p>100% free, even for commercial use!</p>

        <h5>Will the template and shortcut mapper be updated?</h5>

        <p>Most definitely! We intend to keep adding scripts and improving the template. However, be aware that we do this as a hobby and are not affiliated with Figure53. We don’t have any direct influence on QLab changes, so updating might take time, depending on the situation. There will most likely be a big update once QLab 5 launches. (Whenever that happens ⏳)</p>

        <h5>I have a suggestion or an issue with the template, where do I report it?</h5>

        <p>Reach out to Baldrian with an email at <a href="mailto:baldriansector@gmail.com?subject=Tidy Workspace Template">baldriansector@gmail.com</a>. Please include “Tidy Workspace Template” in the subject line.</p>

        <h5>Why does the shortcut mapper not match with my keyboard layout?</h5>

        <p>Short answer is that it’s very hard to make sure everything works the same across different layouts, with the way that the Tidy Workspace Shortcut Mapper and QLab are programmed.
        The technical explanation is that all customisable shortcuts in QLab 4 refer to key positions, rather than key labels. (even the default ones set in Workspace Settings → Key Map) There are differences between some layouts and therefore also conflicts. This can cause some very frustrating situations, when trying to determine which keys to press.
        In QLab, a hotkey is displayed in the Triggers Tab or in the Key Map. When a hotkey is recorded, QLab records the position and current label of the key in that specific layout, but when trying to trigger the hotkey in QLab, only the position is referenced. That ultimately means you can have multiple cues, with the same text in the hotkey tab, but still fire from different key positions. This also works the opposite way. If you want to be sure that a hotkey is actually triggered by the described key, the only safe way is to rerecord it yourself and not change the layout of your keyboard. However, Fixed shortcuts always work differently, based only on key labels.
        In the Tidy Workspace Shortcut Mapper, customisable shortcuts (hotkeys with a trigger) will always work on the same key position as on the Danish layout, regardless of the selected layout. Fixed shortcuts will always be displayed correctly, since QLab 4 treats those by key label.
        We’ve tried to give an as exact representation as possible, but we know that enabling different layouts will cause conflicts, in terms of what is displayed and what will actually work. Therefore we decided to go with a limited palette of keyboards. We generated our hotkeys with a Danish layout. You may therefore find that some of the keyboard shortcuts do not work as shown, for your setup. You may find that the key in the same position as the shown key will work, but will simply have the wrong label. Shortcuts behave as described above.
        We know that there are also some issues with overlapping shortcuts. You can read about our known issues on GitHub.

        <h5>I have a suggestion or an issue with the shortcut mapper, where do I report it?</h5>

        <p>You can directly report it on GitHub, but please read the README.md first. You can also read about already known issues on GitHub.</p>

        <h5>Something went wrong when I used your template, what do I do?</h5>

        <p>We try our best, but unfortunately we cannot guarantee that you won’t have issues. We do not take any responsibility for any lost work. So our best advice when trying out the template is: Remember to do frequent backups!</p>

        <h5>How can I support Tidy Workspace?</h5>

        <p>We are currently a team of only two working on Tidy Workspace (Tidy Workspace Template and Tidy Workspace Shortcut Mapper).
        We have a few expenses for domains, hosting, SSL certificates and other maintenance stuff. If you would like to join us in the fight for tidier workspaces, support us financially or help in any other way, contact Baldrian with an email at <a href="mailto:baldriansector@gmail.com?subject=Tidy Workspace">baldriansector@gmail.com</a>.
